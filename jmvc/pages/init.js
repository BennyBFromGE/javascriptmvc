## Getting Started

If you are new to the framework, the [getstarted Getting Started Guide] is the best place to start.  There, you'll install JavaScriptMVC, create an app, test, compress, and document it.  Or, if you're in a hurry, try the [rapidstart Rapid Start Guide].

## Beyond the basics

After you've mastered the basics, here is some reading to continue your mastery:

  - [learn Learn] - some FAQs about the bigger picture
  - [http://jupiterjs.com/news/organizing-a-jquery-application Organizing a jQuery Application] - the architecture for assembling an app
  - [http://jupiterjs.com/news/creating-a-javascriptmvc-slider Creating a JavaScriptMVC Slider] - how to create a widget
  - [http://jupiterit.com/news/javascriptmvc-features JavaScriptMVC Features] - features list
  - [http://jupiterjs.com/news/javascriptmvc-3-0-good-to-go JavaScriptMVC 3.0 Good to Go] - what's new in the 3.0 release

## Core

Click [#&search=core Core] at the top for links to documentation on each core component.

Each component also has corresponding article(s) over at the blog:

  - [jQuery.Controller Controller]
  - [jQuery.Model Model]
  - [jQuery.View View]
  - [jQuery.Class Class]
  - [stealjs Steal]
  - [FuncUnit FuncUnit]
  
## How to Use the Docs

Use the search box at the top left to find the object, class, attribute, function, page or anything else you are looking for. 

After you've typed a search, click up/down/enter to navigate results in the sidebar.

If you find a method you keep needing to reference, you can favorite it for quick access.  On the right of every page title there is a gray star icon. Click it to save that page as a favorite.  Your favorites are listed when you click "Favorites" on the top right navigation.

## API

If all else fails, head over to the [api API page] for a complete listing of every page in the Documentation.
