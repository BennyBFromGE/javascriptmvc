JavaScriptMVC is comprised of several projects, each with 
it's own repository:

 - [http://github.com/jupiterjs/steal]
 - [http://github.com/jupiterjs/javascriptmvc]
 - [http://github.com/jupiterjs/documentjs]
 - [http://github.com/jupiterjs/funcunit]
 
If you're using git you should read 
the [developwithgit developing with git] article.

If you want to 

 - develop JavaScriptMVC itself
 - build stand alone parts of JavaScriptMVC
 
You'll want to clone / pull 
the [http://github.com/jupiterjs/framework] repository.

After pulling framework, you will have to install the submodules:

@codestart
git submodule init
git submodule update
@codeend

The following is how you can build and test each part:

## FuncUnit

to be filled in shortly

## The MVC and jQuery Libraries

to be filled in shortly

## DocumentJS

to be filled in shortly

## StealJS

to be filled in shortly

## The Framework as a whole
